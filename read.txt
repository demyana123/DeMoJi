If you want to simlate on Veilator tool, all simulation steps and this tool are available on the previous link.

DeMoJi is simulated on Vivado 2020.2 tool because Vivado 2018 causes some issues

on simulation, take care to change the path of your directory in testbench file otherwise the program doesn't work 

Different C codes run on this processor and their results are shown under c-code and waveforms file

Also, CoreMark tool is simulated on our multiprocessor
